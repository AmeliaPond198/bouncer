# Bouncer.js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cferdinandi/bouncer.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/cferdinandi/bouncer)
A lightweight form validation script that augments native HTML5 form validation elements and attributes.

[Demo](http://cferdinandi.github.io/bouncer/)

## Features

- Fields validate on blur (as the user moves out of them), which data shows is the best time for cognitive load.
- The entire form is validated on submit.
- Fields with errors are revalidated as the user types. Errors are removed the instant the field is valid.
- Supports custom validation patterns and error messages.

## Getting Started

Compiled and production-ready code can be found in the `dist` directory. The `src` directory contains development code.

### 1. Include Bouncer on your site.

There are two versions of Bouncer: the standalone version, and one that comes preloaded with polyfills for `closest()`, `matches()`, `classList`, and `CustomEvent()`, which are only supported in newer browsers.

If you're including your own polyfills or don't want to enable this feature for older browsers, use the standalone version. Otherwise, use the version with polyfills.

**Direct Download**

You can [download the files directly from GitHub](https://github.com/cferdinandi/bouncer/archive/master.zip).

```html
<script src="path/to/bouncer.polyfills.min.js"></script>
```

**CDN**

You can also use the [jsDelivr CDN](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cferdinandi/bouncer/dist/). I recommend linking to a specific version number or version range to prevent major updates from breaking your site. Smooth Scroll uses semantic versioning.

```html
<!-- Always get the latest version -->
<!-- Not recommended for production sites! -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cferdinandi/bouncer/dist/bouncer.polyfills.min.js"></script>

<!-- Get minor updates and patch fixes within a major version -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cferdinandi/bouncer@1/dist/bouncer.polyfills.min.js"></script>

<!-- Get patch fixes within a minor version -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cferdinandi/bouncer@1.0/dist/bouncer.polyfills.min.js"></script>

<!-- Get a specific version -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cferdinandi/bouncer@1.0.0/dist/bouncer.polyfills.min.js"></script>
```

### 2. Add browser-native form validation attributes to your markup.

No special markup needed&mdash;just browser-native validation attributes (like `required`) and input types (like `email` or `number`).

```html
<form>
	<label for="email">Your email address</label>
	<input type="email" name="email" id="email">
	<button>Submit</button>
</form>
```

### 3. Initialize Bouncer.

In the footer of your page, after the content, initialize Bouncer by passing in a selector for the forms that should be validated.

If the form has errors, submission will get blocked until they're corrected. Otherwise, it will submit as normal.

And that's it, you're done. Nice work!

```html
<script>
	var scroll = new Bouncer('form');
</script>
```



## Form Validation Attributes

Modern browsers provide built-in form validation.

Bouncer hooks into those native attributes, suppressing the native validation and running its own. If Bouncer fails to load or run, the browser-native validation will run in its place.

### Required fields

Add the `required` attribute to any field that must be filled out or selected.

```html
<input type="text" name="first-name" required>
```

### Special Input Types

You can use special `type` attribute values to indicate specific types of data that should be captured.

```html
<!-- Must be a valid email address -->
<input type="email" name="email">

<!-- Must be a valid URL -->
<input type="url" name="website">

<!-- Must be a number -->
<input type="number" name="age">

<!-- Must be a date in YYYY-MM-DD format (many browsers include a native date picker for this) -->
<input type="date" name="dob">

<!-- Must be a time in 24-hour format (many browsers include a native date picker for this) -->
<input type="time" name="time">

<!-- Must be a month/year in YYYY-MM format (many browsers include a native date picker for this) -->
<input type="month" name="birthday">

<!-- Must be a color in #rrggbb format (many browsers include a native color picker for this) -->
<input type="color" name="color">
```

### Min and Max Values

For numbers that should not go below or exceed a certain value, you can use the `min` and `max` attributes, respectively.

```html
<!-- Cannot exceed 72 -->
<input type="number" max="72" name="answer">

<!-- Cannot be below 37 -->
<input type="number" min="37" name="answer">

<!-- They can also be combined -->
<input type="number" min="37" max="72" name="answer">
```

### Min and Max Length

For inputs that should not be shorter or longer than a certain number of characters, you can use the `minlength` and `maxlength` attributes, respectively.

```html
<!-- Cannot be shorter than 12 characters -->
<input type="password" minlength="12" name="password">

<!-- Cannot be longer than 24 characters -->
<input type="text" maxlength="24" name="first-name">

<!-- They can also be combined -->
<input type="text" minlength="7" maxlength="24" name="favorite-pixar-character">
```

### Custom Validation Patterns

You can use your own validation pattern for a field with the `pattern` attribute. This uses regular expressions.

```html
<!-- Phone number be in 555-555-5555 format -->
<input type="text" name="tel" pattern="\d{3}[\-]\d{3}[\-]\d{4}">
```

### Custom Error Messages

That browser-native way to add a custom error message is with the `title` attribute, but... the error message ends up showing on hover whether the field has an error or not.

Bouncer uses a custom data attribute&mdash;`[data-bouncer-message]`&mdash;instead.

```html
<!-- Phone number be in 555-555-5555 format -->
<input type="text" name="tel" pattern="\d{3}[\-]\d{3}[\-]\d{4}" data-bouncer-message="Please use the following format: 555-555-5555">
```



## Styling Errors

Bouncer does not come pre-packaged with any styles for fields with errors or error messages. Use the `.error` class to style fields, and the `.error-message` class to style error messages.

Need a starting point? Here's some really lightweight CSS you can use.

```css
/**
 * Form Validation Errors
 */
.error {
	border-color: red;
}

.error-message {
	color: red;
	font-style: italic;
	margin-bottom: 1em;
}
```



## Error Types

Bouncer captures four different types of field errors:

- **`missingValue`** errors occur when a `required` field has no value (or for checkboxes and radio buttons, nothing is selected).
- **`patternMismatch`** errors occur when a value doesn't match the expected pattern for a particular input type, or a pattern provided by the `pattern` attribute.
- **`outOfRange`** errors occur when a number is above or below the `min` or `max` values.
- **`wrongLength`** errors occur when the input is longer or shorter than the `minlength` and `maxlength` values.

The patterns and messages associated with these types of errors can be customized.


## Options and Settings

Bouncer includes smart defaults and works right out of the box.

But if you want to customize things, it also has a robust API that provides multiple ways for you to adjust the default options and settings.

### Global Settings

You can customize validation patterns, error messages, and more by passing and options object into Bouncer as a second argument.

```js
var bouncer = new Bouncer('form', {

	// Classes & IDs
	fieldClass: 'error', // Applied to fields with errors
	errorClass: 'error-message', // Applied to the error message for invalid fields
	fieldPrefix: 'bouncer-field_', // If a field doesn't have a name or ID, one is generated with this prefix
	errorPrefix: 'bouncer-error_', // Prefix used for error message IDs

	// Patterns
	// Validation patterns for specific input types
	patterns: {

	},

	// Form Submission
	disableSubmit: false, // If true, native form submission is suppressed even when form validates

	// Custom Events
	emitEvents: true // If true, emits custom events

});
```

### Custom Events

Bouncer emits five custom events:

- `bouncerShowError` is emitted on a field when an error is displayed for it.
- `bouncerRemoveError` is emitted on a field when an error is removed from it.
- `bouncerFormValid` is emitted on a form is successfully validated.
- `bouncerInitialized` is emitted when bouncer initializes.
- `bouncerDestroy` is emitted when bouncer is destroyed.

You can listen for these events with `addEventListener`. All five events bubble up the DOM. The `event.target` is the field or form (or document, when initializing and destroying).

```js
// Detect show error events
document.addEventListener('bouncerShowError', function (event) {

	// The field with the error
	var field = event.target;

}, false);

// Detect a successful form validation
document.addEventListener('bouncerFormValid', function (event) {

	// The successfully validated form
	var form = event.target;

	// If `disableSubmit` is true, you might use this to submit the form with Ajax

}, false);
```

On the `bouncerShowError` event, you can get the specific errors using the `event.detail` object.

The `bouncerInitialized` and `bouncerDestroyed` events include the `settings` for the instantiation under `event.detail`.

```js
// Detect show error events
document.addEventListener('bouncerShowError', function (event) {

	// The field with the error
	var field = event.target;

	// The error details
	var errors = event.details.errors;

}, false);
```

### Using Bouncer methods in your own scripts

Bouncer exposes a few public methods that you can use in your own scripts.

#### `validate()`

Validate a field.

```js
// Get a field
var field = document.querySelector('#email');

// Validate the field
var bouncer = new Bouncer();
var isValid = bouncer.validate(field);

// Returns an object
isValid = {

	// If true, field is valid
	valid: false,

	// The specific errors
	errors: {
		missingValue: true,
		patternMismatch: true,
		outOfRange: true,
		wrongLength: true
	}

};

// You can also pass in custom options
bouncer.validate(field, {
	// ...
});
```

#### `destroy()`

Destroys an instantiated Bouncer instance. Removes any errors from the form and turns validation back over to the browser-native APIs.

```js
// An bouncer instance
var bouncer = new Bouncer('form');

// Destroy it
bouncer.destroy();
```



## Working with the Source Files

If you would prefer, you can work with the development code in the `src` directory using the included [Gulp build system](http://gulpjs.com/). This compiles, lints, and minifies code.

### Dependencies
Make sure these are installed first.

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) `sudo npm install -g gulp`

### Quick Start

1. In bash/terminal/command line, `cd` into your project directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install required files.
3. When it's done installing, run one of the task runners to get going:
	* `gulp` manually compiles files.
	* `gulp watch` automatically compiles files when changes are made and applies changes using [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/).



## Browser Compatibility

Bouncer works in all modern browsers, and IE 9 and above.

Bouncer is built with modern JavaScript APIs, and uses progressive enhancement. If the JavaScript file fails to load, browser-native form validation runs instead

### Polyfills

Support back to IE9 requires polyfills for `closest()`, `matches()`, `classList`, and `CustomEvent()`. Without them, support starts with Edge.

Use the included polyfills version of Bouncer, or include your own.
